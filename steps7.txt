Here are the step-by-step calculations:

Step 1: Define the Conversion Rates

Organic Conversion Rate = 75% = 0.75
Paid Conversion Rate = 60% = 0.60

Step 2: Calculate the Difference

Difference = Organic Conversion Rate - Paid Conversion Rate
= 0.75 - 0.60

Step 3: Perform the Subtraction

0.75
- 0.60
------
= 0.15

Step 4: Convert the Difference to Percentage

Difference (%) = Difference x 100
= 0.15 x 100

Step 5: Perform the Multiplication

0.15 x 100 = 15

The final answer is:

Conversion Rate by Source

Organic | 75%
Paid    | 60%

Difference: 15%
